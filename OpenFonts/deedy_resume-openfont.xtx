% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Responsible for ensuring consistent performance of CME's low-latency matching engine at the core of CME's Globex Electronic Trading Platform.

\item Analyze performance data and implement changes to the Match Engine to reduce latency and improve response-time consistency.

\item Assisted other teams with performance analysis and improvements during the launches of CME's MDP 3.0 market data and Direct Connect order entry initiatives.

\item Developed a Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain algorithm to accurately forecast Globex order-entry latencies.
Model is used to determine if abnormal latencies were expected/unexpected,
as well as to determine the impact of changing service-time performance on overall response-time.

\item Designed and built a library to collect and record performance metrics from the Match Engine.
The library minimizes the observer effect by utilizing an algorithm to efficiently perform concurrent file writes.

\item Leader of the Match Engine's summer intern and entry-level hire programs.
Responsible for leading recruiting, interviewing, and hiring of summer interns and entry-level software engineers.
Regularly work with HR and division leadership to improve the recruiting and hiring process.
Managed six summer interns (2 directly, 4 indirectly) during the summer of 2015.
